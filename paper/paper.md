# Summary

`World Genesis` is an open-source simulator that couples autonomous agents to
a coupled Earth-system, macroeconomic, and geopolitical model on real Earth
geography. Each agent perceives, plans, and acts through a Joint Embedding
Predictive Architecture (JEPA) world model [@lecun2022path; @maes2026leworldmodel],
while a 14-state ordinary-differential-equation (ODE) layer governs global
climate, resources, and socioeconomics. Nation-states emerge organically when
agent settlements coalesce, with bilateral trade and conflict probability
following established gravity-model and International Futures specifications.

The simulator ships with two scenarios. *Scenario A* runs from the
Out-of-Africa migration ~70,000 years before present through to climate
futures beyond 2100, integrating paleoclimate from EPICA ice cores and
geographic determinism in the sense of @diamond1997guns. *Scenario B*
initialises from present-day data (World Bank, NOAA, NASA) and projects
forward at monthly resolution. Every parameter, equation, and boundary
condition is grounded in published literature, and the macro layer passes
9/9 IPCC AR6-calibrated validation checks plus two unit anchors (Mauna
Loa decadal CO₂ growth rate; emergent equilibrium climate sensitivity)
at 2100.

# Statement of need

Existing tools occupy disjoint corners of the design space: integrated
assessment models such as DICE [@nordhaus2017revisiting] and World3
[@meadows1972limits] deliver coherent climate-economic dynamics but treat
populations as aggregate stocks; agent-based models such as Sugarscape and
Schelling-style frameworks deliver emergent behaviour but lack physical
grounding; large language model agents now match human conversational
fidelity but have no persistent world model. `World Genesis` bridges these
traditions: a single shared JEPA world model supplies vector cognition to
hundreds of agents simultaneously, while a calibrated macro ODE supplies
the physical and economic constraints those agents inhabit. The result is
a research instrument suitable for studying emergent civilisation
dynamics, climate-policy counterfactuals, and the coupling between
individual decisions and planetary boundaries.

The package targets three audiences. First, **climate and Earth-system
researchers** who want a tractable testbed for integrated assessment
beyond representative-agent assumptions. Second, **AI researchers** studying
JEPA-style architectures [@maes2026leworldmodel; @qu2026representation] in a
non-toy setting with reward-free exploration over thousands of episodes.
Third, **economists and political scientists** investigating emergent
nation-formation, trade, and conflict from primitive agent interactions
[@hughes2019international; @russett1993grasping].

# Features

- **JEPA cognition** with adaptive layer normalisation, SIGReg
  regularisation [@maes2026leworldmodel], and a Cross-Entropy Method planner.
- **14-state macro ODE** spanning two-layer energy balance, Hubbert resource
  curves [@hubbert1956nuclear], DICE damages [@nordhaus2017revisiting], and
  Earth4All social tension [@dixsondecleve2022earth].
- **Emergent geopolitics**: nation formation by settlement coalescence;
  Tinbergen [@tinbergen1962shaping] gravity trade; logistic conflict
  probability per @hughes2019international.
- **Real Earth geography**: Natural Earth coastlines rasterised to 0.25°,
  Whittaker [@whittaker1975communities] biomes, USGS resource provinces.
- **Reproducibility**: deterministic seeded runs (per-instance random
  generators across encoder, predictor, planner, and minibatch sampling
  decouple training from global state), structured CSV+JSON logging, a
  9/9 IPCC validation suite plus two unit anchors, a figure-generation
  pipeline, and a published validation report.

# Validation

Running the BAU macro path 2025–2100 produces CO₂ = 679 ppm, ΔT = +2.74 °C,
sea-level rise = 0.61 m, and population = 8.37 B, all within bounds derived
from the IPCC AR6 SSP2-4.5 to SSP3-7.0 envelope and the Vollset (2020) /
UN WPP 2024 demographic range. The CO₂ growth rate around 2030 is 2.58 ppm/yr,
inside the NOAA GML Mauna Loa decadal mean envelope of 2.4–3.0 ppm/yr; the
emergent equilibrium climate sensitivity is 3.00 °C, matching the declared
IPCC AR6 best estimate exactly via the calibrated climate-feedback parameter
λ = F<sub>2x</sub>/ECS = 1.236 W m<sup>-2</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>. Full reference
values, tolerance bands, and the reproduction command appear in
[`docs/validation.md`](../docs/validation.md).
